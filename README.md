# Like. - Photo Contest
"Like. Photo Contest" is a web-based photo contest app where you can invite your friends and family to upload photos from your computer or mobile device onto the web-hosted database. You have the ability to vote on photos by liking the posts or say what's on your mind by adding a comment. You can browse through all your posts and posts from previous contests.

## Technologies Used:
* Python
* Django
    * For the backend, I used Django 
    * I used Python as our main coding language. Using CreateView, UpdateView, and DeleteView, we used class-based functions to perform our CRUD operations.
* HTML
* CSS
* Heroku
    * I used Heroku to host my app.
* boto3
    * I used boto3 to link to my Amazon Web Services account in order to upload photos directly from file.
